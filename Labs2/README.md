# Labs 02 : ConfigMap

In this lab, we will create a config map file to expose a nginx pod with a custom index.html.

To do so, we need to update our last nginx-pod.yml to mount a volume in the default nginx server folder (/usr/share/nginx/html).
Just as before, the conmmand.txt file sums up all the commands used in this lab.
